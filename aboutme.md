Hey there! Welcome to my corner of the web! My name is Lars Kristian, and I'm a curious, fun-loving computer scientist based in the bustling city of Frankfurt. I've earned my stripes with a master's degree in computer science and have a passion for all things tech, innovation, and exploration.

When I'm not rocking the data scientist role by day, you can find me in my creative lair, inventing and 3D printing cool contraptions like Aperol spritz machines (because who doesn't love a good spritz?) and hydroponic towers for urban gardening enthusiasts. My insatiable curiosity and love for learning have also led me to develop Kiwi Flashcards, an app available on the App Store that aims to make learning new languages a breeze.

But life isn't all just ones and zeroes for me. I'm an active, sociable person who loves to hit the gym, meet up with friends, and tinker with microelectronics to build the next fun gadget or gizmo. If you share my zest for life and passion for innovation, we're bound to have a great time together!

So, whether you're here to learn more about my projects, share your ideas, or simply get to know me better, I'm excited to have you on this journey. Let's connect and explore the wonders of technology and life together. Cheers!

### My story

From my high school graduation in 2016 at the Willigis Gymnasium, a unique boys' school, my journey into the world of computer science began. Through my volunteer work as a youth group leader, I gained valuable team-working skills that have guided me throughout my career. This role allowed me to offer young people a fresh perspective and inspired a few to venture into the IT field.

During my freshment year in high school, I embarked on a six-month adventure to the United States, more specifically Alaska, in 2013. From childhood, America was a land of endless possibilities that fascinated me. Living in Alaska provided me with an opportunity for self-discovery and to experience the American lifestyle firsthand.

Eager to explore my cultural roots further, I moved to Oslo, Norway in March 2019 after finishing high school. I decided to learn Norwegian and enrolled in the International Summer School in Oslo. Besides the language course, I engaged in a course in Scandinavian Government and Politics and actively participated in the Student Council. The enriching experience exposed me to diverse cultures and allowed me to add another foreign language to my portfolio.

Upon returning to Germany, I moved to Mannheim to pursue my degree in business informatics, a field that beautifully married my interest in economics and technology. During this time, I developed a stronger inclination towards computer science, which led me to write my bachelor thesis in IT security.

Post my bachelor's degree, I immediately enrolled in a master's program at the University of Mainz. I wrote my Masterthesis on training AI on business multi relational databases, keen to explore the integration of modern deep learning techniques in businesses.

My professional journey began at Sicher hoch Drei, where I consulted customers on DSGVO and IT Security. I had the responsibility of designing and implementing a 7-day training course on IT security as per ISO 27001 and BSI IT-Grundschutz along with the DSGVO. Additionally, I conducted research on various consulting topics in the areas of house and server technology concerning IT security in public communities.

Transitioning from Sicher hoch Drei, I took up a role at Arlanis Reply AG, where I found myself immersed in the world of Salesforce development and consultancy. My responsibilities were multifaceted and included developing business applications, both in the front and backend, utilizing languages such as Apex, JavaScript, and SQL.

I was deeply involved in the entire development process. It started from the conception phase, where I communicated with customers to understand their unique requirements. This was followed by meticulously planning the development process, implementing the solution, and conducting rigorous testing to ensure the solution met the customers' needs.

An integral part of my role involved working with cross-cloud extensions and integrating third-party systems, providing comprehensive solutions to clients. I was also a key player in the pre-sales team, where I managed inquiries related to machine learning integration, thereby marrying my academic focus with practical applications.

In conjunction with my work at Arlanis Reply AG, I embarked on an academic endeavor. I started working on a master's thesis titled “Promoting Variables from Dimension Tables to Target Variables in Multi-Relational Data Mining”. This research allowed me to delve deeper into the practical applications of machine learning, enhancing my understanding and capabilities in the field.

In my current role at Deloitte's AI and Data Analytics Team, I am involved in developing chatbots in Omniverse using large language models and working on various AI topics. This exciting role allows me to leverage my skills in AI and machine learning, driving technological innovation for businesses.

Looking back, my academic and career path has been a stimulating journey, filled with diverse experiences and opportunities to learn and grow. Each stage has been instrumental in shaping my understanding of the field, and I am excited about what lies ahead.
