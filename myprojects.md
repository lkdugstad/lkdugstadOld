### Face Mask Detection
Winter is Coming, and the spread of the coronavirus will most likely continue in an even more concerning way. To stop the spread of the disease and break infection chains, it is important to keep distance and wear a mask.  Unfortunately, nowadays it is often seen that people do not want to adhere to the mask requirement, simply forget about it or wear the mask incorrectly. To solve this problem, this project tries to apply machine learning techniques to develop artificial intelligence that can classify if a person is wearing a mask or not and remind people of wearing masks. In the case of a person wearing a mask, it should also identify if the mask is worn correctly. The trained neural network should then be applied to computer vision, to include it in our daily life. To make it widely available to use, we will make it run on a Raspberry Pi.
Followup soon.

### Reinforcement Learning
What is reinforcement learning and how will it affect our lives in the future? Reinforcement learning is the third pillar of machine learning alongside supervised and unsupervised learning. Machine Learning sounds like magic to a lot of people and some refer to it as the black box of computer science. But there is more to it than just magic.

### Hand Sign Language and Machine Learning
As part of my studies, I took a machine learning course. From this, my interest in the area has developed. So I thought about how a neural network could help us in times of corona. Having watched a television program about the language barriers of the deaf and dumb, I thought I could take on this problem and start looking for a solution. The result is interestingâ€¦

### Personal Voice Assistant
As i am keen to learn more and more about the adoption of technology in everyday life, i decided to build a voice assistant, which is tailored to my needs and can hopefully outplay Google Home, Alexa and Siri. It is still in the making and the code will follow.
